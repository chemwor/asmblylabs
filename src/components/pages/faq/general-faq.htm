            Asmbly Labs is infrastructure for distributed manufacturing, focused on 3D printing. We connect sellers, makers, and designers to enable local fulfillment of physical products. When a customer places an order, we route it to a nearby maker who 3D prints and ships the item locally.

            No. Sellers can offer 3D printed products without owning equipment or holding inventory. Our network of makers handles all production and shipping. If you're a maker, you do need reliable 3D printing equipment to fulfill orders.

            Fulfillment speed depends on print complexity and local maker capacity. Simple items can often be completed within 1-3 days, while complex or large items may take longer. Local production means shorter shipping distances and faster delivery to customers.

            Sellers receive their profit margin after production and platform fees. Makers earn for each completed order based on material, complexity, and time. Designers receive royalties when their licensed STL files are used. All payouts are processed regularly and transparently.
