          This platform and website (hereafter referred to as "Asmbly Labs", "platform", or "service") is owned and operated by Asmbly Labs, Inc. (hereafter referred to as "Asmbly Labs", "we", "us", or "company").
        </p>
        <p>
          Please carefully read, review, and understand our Terms and Conditions before using our distributed manufacturing platform. Your access to and use of this platform indicates that you accept and agree to be bound by these terms and conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do not agree with these terms, you should discontinue use of the platform immediately and not participate in any manufacturing, selling, or design activities through our network.

        <h3>1. Platform Overview and User Types</h3>
        <p>
          Asmbly Labs operates a distributed manufacturing platform that connects three primary user types: Sellers (who list and sell 3D-printed products), Makers (who own 3D printers and fulfill orders locally), and Designers (who create and license STL files for production).
        </p>
        <p>
          By using our platform, you agree to operate within your designated user role(s) and comply with all applicable quality standards, delivery requirements, and payment terms specific to your participation type.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div data-ns-animate data-delay="0.5" class="space-y-6">
        <h3>2. Order Fulfillment and Quality Standards</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>For Sellers:</strong> You are responsible for accurate product descriptions, pricing, and customer communication. Orders routed through our platform must meet the specifications you provide. You accept responsibility for customer satisfaction related to product quality and delivery timing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>For Makers:</strong> You must fulfill orders according to specified materials, quality standards, and delivery timeframes. You are responsible for maintaining equipment capability standards and communicating any production delays or quality issues promptly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>For Designers:</strong> You warrant that you own or have proper licensing rights to all STL files uploaded to our platform. Files must be printable and meet technical specifications for successful manufacturing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div data-ns-animate data-delay="0.6" class="space-y-6">
        <h3>3. Payment Terms and Revenue Distribution</h3>
        <p>
          Asmbly Labs facilitates payment distribution between sellers, makers, and designers according to agreed revenue splits. Payment processing occurs after successful order completion and any applicable quality verification periods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users are responsible for providing accurate payment information and complying with applicable tax obligations. Asmbly Labs is not responsible for tax reporting or withholding on behalf of users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Disputes regarding payment amounts, quality, or delivery must be reported within 14 days of order completion. We reserve the right to withhold payments during active dispute resolution.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div data-ns-animate data-delay="0.7" class="space-y-6">
        <h3>4. Intellectual Property and STL File Licensing</h3>
        <p>
          Designers retain ownership of their STL files while granting Asmbly Labs and participating makers limited licensing rights for production and fulfillment purposes. Unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or modification of STL files outside the platform is prohibited.
        </p>
        <p>
          Makers may only use STL files for orders routed through our platform and must delete files after order completion unless otherwise specified in licensing terms. Reverse engineering or unauthorized sharing of design files will result in immediate account termination.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div data-ns-animate data-delay="0.8" class="space-y-6">
        <h3>5. Platform Availability and Technical Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          While we strive to maintain platform availability, Asmbly Labs does not guarantee uninterrupted service. Manufacturing operations, order routing, and payment processing may experience temporary disruptions due to maintenance, technical issues, or external factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users are responsible for maintaining compatible equipment, software, and internet connectivity required for platform participation. We provide technical specifications and requirements but do not guarantee compatibility with all hardware or software configurations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div data-ns-animate data-delay="0.9" class="space-y-6">
        <h3>6. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>
          Asmbly Labs serves as a coordination platform and is not directly responsible for manufacturing quality, delivery performance, or disputes between users. Our liability is limited to facilitating connections and processing payments according to platform agreements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under no circumstances shall Asmbly Labs be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including but not limited to manufacturing defects, delivery delays, equipment damage, or business interruption arising from platform use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users assume responsibility for their own manufacturing quality, equipment maintenance, customer relationships, and compliance with local regulations and safety standards.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div data-ns-animate data-delay="1.0" class="space-y-6">
        <h3>7. Account Terms and Termination</h3>
        <p>
          User accounts are non-transferable and tied to verified identity and payment information. Makers must provide accurate equipment specifications and capability information. Sellers must maintain valid store integrations and customer service standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts for violations of quality standards, payment terms, intellectual property policies, or other terms of service. Termination may result in forfeiture of pending payments or revenue sharing during active disputes.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div data-ns-animate data-delay="1.1" class="space-y-6">
        <h3>8. Geographic Limitations and Compliance</h3>
        <p>
          Platform availability varies by geographic region based on shipping capabilities, regulatory requirements, and maker network coverage. Users must comply with local manufacturing regulations, safety standards, and import/export restrictions applicable to 3D printing and product distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
          International users are responsible for understanding and complying with customs, duties, and cross-border shipping requirements for their participation in our distributed manufacturing network.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div data-ns-animate data-delay="0.3" class="space-y-6">
        <h3>9. Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <p>
          Disputes between platform users (sellers, makers, designers) should first be addressed through our internal resolution process. Asmbly Labs will facilitate communication and provide order tracking information to help resolve quality, delivery, or payment issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          For disputes that cannot be resolved through platform mediation, users agree to pursue resolution through binding arbitration rather than court proceedings, except where prohibited by applicable law.

        <h3>10. Changes to Terms</h3>
        <p>
          Asmbly Labs reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions as our platform evolves and regulatory requirements change. Users will be notified of significant changes through platform notifications and email communications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Continued use of the platform after terms modification indicates acceptance of updated terms. Users who disagree with changes may terminate their accounts and cease platform participation.
